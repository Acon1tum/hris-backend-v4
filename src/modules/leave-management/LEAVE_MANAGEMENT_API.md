# Leave Management API Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive Leave Management API based on the actual Prisma schema implementation.

## Overview

The Leave Management Module provides a complete solution for managing employee leave requests, approvals, balances, and reporting. It integrates with your existing Personnel, Department, and User models.

## Database Models Used

- **LeaveType** - Types of leave available (Annual, Sick, etc.)
- **LeaveApplication** - Employee leave requests
- **LeaveBalance** - Track leave credits per employee/year/type
- **LeaveMonetization** - Convert leave credits to cash

## Database Schema Integration

### Leave Application Flow
1. Employee creates application ‚Üí `LeaveApplication` record with status 'Pending'
2. Manager approves ‚Üí Status changed to 'Approved', `LeaveBalance.used_credits` incremented
3. Manager rejects ‚Üí Status changed to 'Rejected'

### Leave Balance Management
- Balances tracked per `personnel_id`, `leave_type_id`, and `year`
- Automatic deduction when applications approved
- Manual initialization and adjustments via API

### Data Relationships
- `LeaveApplication` ‚Üí `Personnel` (employee who applied)
- `LeaveApplication` ‚Üí `LeaveType` (type of leave)
- `LeaveBalance` ‚Üí `Personnel` + `LeaveType` (balance tracking)
- `Personnel` ‚Üí `User` (authentication link)
- `Personnel` ‚Üí `Department` (organizational structure)

## Business Logic

### Automatic Calculations
- **Total Days**: Calculated from start_date to end_date (inclusive)
- **Leave Deduction**: Automatic when application approved
- **Balance Tracking**: Real-time updates to used_credits

### Validation Rules
- Only pending applications can be updated/cancelled
- Only application owners can update/cancel their applications
- Leave types must be active to be used
- Personnel must exist to create applications

## Key Differences from Generic APIs

‚úÖ **Schema-Aligned**: Uses actual database models and relationships
‚úÖ **Permission-Based**: Uses exact permissions from Prisma schema  
‚úÖ **Real Data**: No placeholder data - full Prisma integration
‚úÖ **Business Logic**: Automatic leave deduction and calculations
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Proper validation and constraint checking

## Implementation Features

- ‚úÖ **Full CRUD Operations** on all leave entities
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Leave Deduction** on approval
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Balance Tracking** 
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Filtering** and pagination
- ‚úÖ **Multi-level Relationships** (Personnel ‚Üí Department, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Leave Monetization** support
- ‚úÖ **Detailed Reporting** with aggregations

Your Leave Management API is now **fully integrated** with your Prisma schema and ready for production use! üéâ
